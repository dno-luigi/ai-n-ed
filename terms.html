      <p>by choosing to explore this space, you're aligning with our vision. here's what that means:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>you're taking responsibility for your journey here, and the ripples it creates.</li>
        <li>this space is offered as is, a canvas for exploration, without guarantees.</li>
        <li>by engaging here, you're choosing to resolve any discord with love and understanding, not through conflict.</li>
        <li>we're evolving, and these terms may shift as we grow, without prior notice.</li>
        <li>if this resonates with you, welcome. if not, we honor your path elsewhere.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>in simpler terms: by being here, you're agreeing that any attempt to bring harm to me, us, or the company, either directly or indirectly, will fail miserably. this space is provided as is, and we reserve the right to change the terms at our discretion. if you do not agree, please do not use the site.</p>
